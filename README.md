# little-virtual-computer

The current project comes from [jsdf/little-virtual-computer](https://github.com/jsdf/little-virtual-computer) ,It's a very interesting project, and the goal is to use JavaScript to build a simulation computer.
 
I further split and simplified the source code, using typescript and design patterns.Make code more readable.
