# little-virtual-computer

The current project comes from [jsdf/little-virtual-computer](https://github.com/jsdf/little-virtual-computer) ,It's a very interesting project, and the goal is to use JavaScript to build a simulation computer.
 
At present, the virtual machine uses JavaScript Array to simulate memory, and operates memory together with instructions to control data and display. 
 
I further split and simplified the source code, using TypeScript and design patterns.Make the source code more readable and extensible.
